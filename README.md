#Anthony Tirado SEIR - Project 1 - War

####Game Description
######This is a game of War. War is a simple game where two players each receive half of a normal deck of cards, and reveal the top card in each of their decks. Whoevers card value is highest takes both cards and adds them to their deck. However, if both players cards are the same value then it is war. During a war scenario, 3 cards are taken from each players deck and the final card is compared. The higher value in this situation would be determined as the winner and that player receives all the cards. The game ends when one player has completely run out of cards or is unable to participate in a war due to lack of cards.

##Technologies Used

* I used HTML to create a basic display of the game. I implented buttons for starting each round and resetting the game.

* I used CSS to style the game, opting for visually appealing colors and simple UI design. Making sure everything is centered in the screen and is easily accessible.

* I used Javascript for functionality. I declared constant variables such as the deck, the hands, and gameplay counters. I utilized event listeners for the "Play" and "Reset" buttons. I implemented functions to set up the game, and start the framework for logic to be applied. I also implemented functions responsible for the game logic. Both for and while loops and if-else conditionals are responsible for guiding game logic and flow. Various array operations are used to manage both the deck and player hands. DOM Manipulation is utilized to create the visual representation of the cards shown at random.
